This is the user interface of our web app to predict the malignancy of a breast cancer tumor.
# Project description
This is a Machine Learning & Data Science Project that we will try to build a predicting model to classify the malignancy of a breast cancer tumor using ultrasound images converted to mathematical features. The model will use this related data of a particular tumor. Of course, we will have to clean the data & make a simple EDA to understand it more.
